# LinearRegression
Business problem - A leading bike sharing company needed to understand the reason for a dip in revenue during the pandemic by modeling the demand for shared bikes. Specifically - what factors are affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.
Implementation -Â  Implemented a multiple linear regression model to understand the variables that are significant for demand prediction and how well these variables are describing the bike demands. The model building and residual analysis was implemented by using the sklearn library in Python with an R squared of 0.80. Below is the step-by-step approach:
1. Read, understand, visualize data
2. Prepare data for modelling
    2.1 Train-Test Split
    2.2 Rescaling
3. Train the model
4. Residual Analysis
5. Prediction & evaluation on the test data set
